# Task 2: Sprint Plan for Educational Game
The task for this week was to plan out an 8-week sprint for an educational maths game, planning out each key feature such as the core gameplay, progression, a dialogue system, localization, UI, rewards, and SFX and animations.

To create the plan, I created a Trello board as I could create multiple lists for each week to plan out what each week would be about.
