## Lesson Task

## Project Development


Since I finished changing the art assets to make my game unique, I wanted to move away from the art aspect of my project to continue focusing on the devlelopment of the mechanics over the next two weeks. I had three primary mechanics I wanted to add, that being the Inventory System, Enemy AI, and Environmental Objects such as Doors and Lab Vents.

### Enemy AI
I first chose to further develop the Enemy AI so it could actually move and attack the player.




### Water


### Rope Swinging
