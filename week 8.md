-Slimeball-
Fun to use, the movement options are nice
How to get the player to not spend too much time in slimeball state:
.Make the slimeball state the default state?
.Make the slimeball a time-limited but more powerful state

-Controls-
Movement is too slow
Some controls aren't explained well (Rope Swinging)
Level is too open-ended, so a player might not see everything on their way to the boss room
The player can skip the first hook if they jump in slimeball state since it's not made obvious that it exists
Having an insta-kill fail state for missing the rope swing was a bit harsh.
