# Task 2: Sprint Plan for Educational Game
The task for this week was to plan out an 8-week sprint for an educational maths game, planning out each key feature such as the core gameplay, progression, a dialogue system, localization, UI, rewards, and SFX and animations.

For references, I loaded up some online flash games on math playground, saw how they worked, and decided to consider some of their choices when considering my educational game. However I wanted to make it unique, and not just a copy of their game. (Because they had enough reskins of their own games as it is)

To create the plan, I created a Trello board as I could create sections for each 2-week sprint, and different sections for each of the tasks to achieve in the sprint.
