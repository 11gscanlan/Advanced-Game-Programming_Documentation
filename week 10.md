# Week 10

As week 10 was the final week, I spent most of my time working on the development journal as well as my theory essay.

During the lesson I decided to go back to the weekly tasks for week 2 and 5 as I hadn't completed those. Initially I hadn't finished Week 2's work as it required a lot of typing and the PC I was working at had a very sticky keyboard and it made typing really annoying.

After that it was just a case of finishing everything to the best of my ability and submitting it for the handin deadline.

## Final Reflection
Overall, I felt I got quite a lot done in the 10 weeks, and got a sizeable prototype created in the 10 weeks.

If I would do anything differently, I would've made sure not to fall behind on the Development Journal work, as not keeping track of things early on will inevitably mean that I end up forgetting them later on, it also would mean less work closer to the hand-in point.
